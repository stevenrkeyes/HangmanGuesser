# HangmanGuesser

HangmanGuesser is an AI for playing the game hangman. It searches a corpus of English words and selects those that match a pattern in a game of hangman. Then, it provides letter suggestions sorted in order of information content obtained by guessing them and learning whether or not they form words. I seem to recal that it demonstrates every game of hangman can be won in about 14 guesses worst case, much fewer than the 26 letters of the alphabet.
